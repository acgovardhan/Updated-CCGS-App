# College and Career Guidance System (CCGS) Desktop Application

**An upgraded Desktop-App version of our original CCGS project that replaces file storage with a mysql based cloud database and packages everything into an easy-to-use executable. All the same great features, now with better performance and simpler setup.**  

---

### 🚀 Major Upgrades from Legacy Version
- **From Files to Cloud**: Replaced local file storage with TiDB Cloud database for real-time data access
- **No More Dependencies**: Bundled JRE and MySQL connector means users don't need to install Java or drivers
- **Professional Packaging**: Now distributed as a clean Windows executable (.exe) instead of raw Java files
---

### ✨ New Features  

- **One-Click Launch**  
  🚀 Double-click `CCGS.exe` to start - no Java/JDK installation required (includes bundled JRE)  

- **Cloud-Powered Data**  
  ☁️ Always up-to-date data via TiDB Cloud database  

- **Smart Connectivity Check**  
  🌐 Automatically verifies internet access by pinging `google.com` (no user data transmitted)  
  - Notifies users if cloud features are unavailable due to lack of internet 

- **Self-Contained Package**  
  📦 Includes all dependencies (Java Runtime + MySQL connector)
